## Carsties
Microservice auction application built using Next.Js and ASP.Net Core WebAPI.

### Origins
This repository contains code written while completing the Udemy course [Build a Microservice app with .NET and Next.Js from scratch](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-microservices-app-with-dotnet-and-nextjs-from-scratch/) written by Neil Cummings.

My code contains some additions and changes, most notably in relation to the use of Docker orchestrator support in Visual Studio.

I have not currently implemented the contents of Neil's course appendices that add support for Kubernetes.

Neil's original repository for the course can be found here: [https://github.com/TryCatchLearn/Carsties](https://github.com/TryCatchLearn/Carsties)
